1a) The "draw" and "place" buttons are toggle-switches. That is, push "draw" to engage, push "draw" again to disengage.
1b) Only one can be engaged. Engaging one disengages the other.

2a) When "draw" is selected, "shape" and "count" items should be disabled
2b) When "place" is selected, see below for details

3a) When "place" is selected, the mouse cursor should change to crosshairs, but only when it's over the scene.
    When the user clicks in the scene, the sprite represented in the "shape" menu should be
    placed where the mouse is clicked.

3b) When "draw" is selected, the mouse cursor should change to a pen, but only when it's over the scene

3c) When neither is selected, the mouse cursor should be the usual kind everywhere

4) There are three independent dropdown menus under the "shape" heading, one for each radio button selection. That is,
    there is an "agents" dropdown with agent images in it, an "objects" dropdown with object images, etc. We will
    show only one dropdown menu at a time; the other two will be hidden. We will show the dropdown for the selected
    radio button: "agents" dropdown for "agents" radio button, etc. When a radio button is selected, we display the
    corresponding dropdown in its closed state, showing the currently selected image.

    It's ok to continue using the faces. I have an artist working on the final images. I just need three menus.

5a) If the "agents" radio button is selected, the "Shape" label should change to "Avatar".
5b) If the "agents" radio button is not selected, the "count" input field should be disabled, and "Avatar"
    should change to "Shape".

6) I was terrible at describing the spinner+input components. I've drawn some pictures to help make it more sensible.
    The input field is an exponent that can be either negative or positive. The 10 is just fixed text. The reason for
    this ugly contraption is that I want to enable the user to set the scale of the slider. He needs the flexibility
    to slide in the milli range but also in the kilo range. If you have any better ideas on presenting an exponential
    slider, I would love to hear them. If you don't have any ideas, please add the work of changing those
    spinner+inputs to behave as in the drawing I've attached.
