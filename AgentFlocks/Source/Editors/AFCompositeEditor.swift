    // are added to them). There's some corresponding hackery in the motivators reader,
    // to assign these serial numbers to motivators as they're created. If I ever get to
    // the point where I feel like saving and loading files again, I'll have to read the
    // highest serial number in the incoming data and start the new serial numbers from there.
