I pulled a lot of hair out trying to figure out how to use GKGoals and GKBehaviors in Apple's GameplayKit. Here's an app that will help you figure it out, hopefully in less time than it took me.

I hope to have it running at least at alpha quality by mid-January 2018. Let me know if you feel like helping, especially if you're good with UI and front-end related stuff: delegates, NSThis and NSThat. I suck at it.
